MSN File Transfer protocol report [@author Jang-Ho Hwang rath@linuxkorea.co.kr]

  Notice:
    - Every MIME message must send a trailing \r\n\r\n.
    - Each property has no order
    - Need not URL-Encode, but UTF-8 encoding.

  Every MIME message must include the following two properties.

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Mime-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/x-msmsgsinvite; charset=UTF-8
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  After Content-Type property write, you must send additional CRLF.(not 1 but 2)

  First, you must send Invitation command(INVITE).

  [Sender -> Receiver]
  Application-Name: 颇老 傈价
  Application-GUID: {5D3E02AB-6190-11d3-BBBB-00C04F795683}
  Invitation-Command: INVITE
  Invitation-Cookie: xxxxxx   (Random number with 6 field)
  Application-File: ${Filename}
  Application-FileSize: ${Filesize(byte)}

  > Example

  Application-Name: 颇老 傈价
  Application-GUID: {5D3E02AB-6190-11d3-BBBB-00C04F795683}
  Invitation-Command: INVITE
  Invitation-Cookie: 126174
  Application-File: Sleep now in the fire.mp3
  Application-FileSize: 4048576

  The receiver can accept or reject.
  The following is Accept message.
 
  [Receiver -> Sender]
  Application-Name: 颇老 傈价
  Application-GUID: {5D3E02AB-6190-11d3-BBBB-00C04F795683}
  Invitation-Command: ACCEPT  (Accept code)
  Invitation-Cookie: 126174   (Cookie value when receive invitation)
  Launch-Application: FALSE
  Request-Data: IP-Address:   (Do not replace ${IP-Address} to your ip address!)

  The following is Reject message.

  [Receiver -> Sender]  
  Invitation-Command: CANCEL  (Reject code)
  Invitation-Cookie: 126174   (Cookie value when receive invitation)
  Cancel-Code: REJECT         (Reject code, REJECT or TIMEOUT or .. ?)

  If receiver reject a file transfer request, file transfer transaction will be 
  terminate. If receiver accept a invitation, receiver must send 'accept' message.

  [Sender -> Receiver]  
  Invitation-Command: ACCEPT  (Accept code)
  Invitation-Cookie: 126174   (Cookie value when send invitation)
  AuthCookie: 15148272        (Authenticate random number, may be 8 field?)
  Launch-Application: FALSE   
  Request-Data: IP-Address:
  IP-Address: 192.168.1.10    (Sender's public host address)
  Port: 6891                  (Bind port number(default 6891), but any port number available)

The receiver can connect sender's PC via TCP/IP.
Receiver open a socket with a last MIME message information.
(In this example, new Socket("192.168.1.10", 6891))

Mark S: Sender
Mark R: Receiver

Each message's separator is CRLF.
(In anytime, you can cancel a file transfer transaction by write 'CCL')

R: VER MSNFTP 
S: VER MSNFTP 
R: USR ${Receiver's LoginName} ${AuthCookie}
S: FIL ${FileSize}
R: TFR 
S: binary write.

Before write a binary, you must send a following 3 bytes.

First, 0 (simple padding?)
Second and third byte is packet size.
The packet size is represent by LITTLE ENDIAN.
And maximum packet size is 0x7FD so that your packet size must little than 00FD07.
(Maybe MTU?)

[For a java programmer]
 
 byte[] buf = new byte[ 2048 ];
 FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
 int readlen;
 while( (readlen=fis.read(buf, 3, 2045))!=-1 )
 {
   buf[0] = 0;
   buf[1] = (byte)((readlen>>0) & 0xff);
   buf[2] = (byte)((readlen>>8) & 0xff);
   out.write( buf, 0, readlen+3 );
   out.flush();
 }
[EOJ]

After write a binary, you must write 3 bytes that all zero.

  write( 0 );
  write( 0 );
  write( 0 );

R: BYE 16777989

the last parameter 1677989 is magic number.
If you write a different value, receiver is notified 
'File transfer is insufficient'
